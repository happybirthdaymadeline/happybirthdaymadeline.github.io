    You've finally come upon the letter, I hope I didn't annoy you too much with all the trouble, can't have just anybody reading your letter<3. First off: Happy seventeenth birthday! You know I love you ;*. We've been dating for over two years and in that time, you've had three birthdays. Each year you get even more beautiful. You have a heart like no other person on the planet and you're truly a one of a kind. I can never forget how blessed I am to be able to love somebody like you, and have you love me back. Your good qualities far surpass those that I could ever wish for. You're super sweet, you're drop-dead gorgeous, you're an amazingly talented dancer and singer, your body is perfect, your personality is perfect, you're considerate, and even funny in your own adorable way. You're truely the total package.
    I was hoping to get this letter done before you got to the game so you could read it, but at this rate you probably will have to wait until tonight. Good luck with your game against Byron Nelson, I bet you guys can win. Thank you so much for being an amazing supportive girlfriend. I love you more than you could even imagine!<3

    With lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and a whole freaking ton of love,
        Your loving boyfriend
            Brayden ;*
